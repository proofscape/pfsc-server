Let's talk about this stuff, and refer to <pdf:>[doc1 as a whole]{
    doc: doc1,
}, and then say something about <pdf:>[a particular spot within doc1]{
    doc: doc1,
    sel: "v2;s3;(1:1758:2666:400:200:100:50);n;x+35;y+4;(1:1758:2666:400:250:110:49)",
}.

Let's then imagine we refer twice more to points within doc1. The first time,
<pdf:>[we'll pass the doc reference as a string]{
    doc: "doc1",
    sel: "v2;s3;(1:1758:2666:400:200:100:50);n;x+35;y+4;(1:1758:2666:400:250:110:49)",
}, and the second time we'll omit the `doc` field altogether, and instead use
<pdf:>[a two-part code in the `sel` field]{
    sel: "doc1#v2;s3;(1:1758:2666:400:200:100:50);n;x+35;y+4;(1:1758:2666:400:250:110:49)",
}.
All these different forms should work.
