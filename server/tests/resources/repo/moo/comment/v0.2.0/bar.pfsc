from test.moo.bar.results import Pf

anno NotesS on Pf.S @@@
These are some notes on node `S` in the proof.

And <goal:w1>[this]{} is a goal widget.

In the previous version, there was a system-named widget here. Its libpath will
go away in this version, and we are silent about this in the repo's move-mapping,
but the system should not complain, since the widget was system-named.

deduc xpan_S of Pf.S {

    asrt A {
        en = "A supporting fact."
    }

    meson = "
    Pf.S by A and Pf.R.
    "
}

anno NotesT on Pf.T @@@
These are some notes on node `T` in the proof.

We now add a fancy new widget that makes these notes better:
<qna:w1>[]{
    question: "What is $-1$ as a complex exponential?",
    answer: "$@rme sup i pie;$"
}

deduc xpan_T of Pf.T {

    asrt B {
        en = "An underlying observation."
    }

    meson = "
    Pf.T by B.
    "

}

anno NotesU2 @@@
In the previous version, there was a system-named widget here. Its libpath will
go away in this version.

This is similar to what we did in `NotesS`, but this time we've also renamed the
annotation from `NotesU` to `NotesU2`, and declared this renaming in the repo's
move-mapping. By doing this, we test a different case ("Rbar subseteq M") in the
`ModuleIndexInfo.cut_add_validate()` method than was tested in `NotesS` (which
was the "V_minus subseteq Dbar" case).
