* Introduce type checking for widget fields.
* Raise exception on presence of unexpected widget fields.
* The string format that was introduced for `color` and `hoverColor` in
    Sphinx is now accepted both in Sphinx and in annos, as an alternative
    to the older, dictionary format. The older format is also still accepted
    in both places.
* Improve error reporting on malformed JSON in widgets in Sphinx pages.
