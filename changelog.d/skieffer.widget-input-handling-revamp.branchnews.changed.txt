* Uniformize widget field names to always use lower camel case.
* Introduce type checking for widget fields.
* Raise exception on presence of unexpected widget fields.
* Uniformize widget field value types across annos and Sphinx pages.
    Now the same JSON types that are used in annos are also required
    in Sphinx.
* The string format that was introduced for `color` and `hoverColor` in
    Sphinx is now accepted both in Sphinx and in annos, as an alternative
    to the older, dictionary format. The older format is also still accepted
    in both places.
