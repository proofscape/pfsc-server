## next (------)

Improvements:

* Improve output of `pfsc.blueprints.cli.auto_deps_build()`.
* Support editable sections in display widgets
  ([#13](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/13)).
* When nodes define both latex and docref labels, the latter now only serves
  to navigate a linked doc; it contributes to the label only when no latex
  label is defined
  ([#18](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/18)).
* In addition to the old navigation links `N --> C` (notes to charts), we now
  support `D --> T` (doc to tree) as well as `N <--> D <--> C`
  ([#21](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/21)).
* Navigation links are editable via drag-and-drop, and via tab context menu
  ([#21](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/21)).
* When defining a docref `doc#code` for a node, may omit the `doc#` part
  if a `docInfo` field is defined in the surrounding deduc
  ([#21](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/21)).
* New pdf widget syntax: added `doc` field; `sel` may point to a node libpath,
  to clone its doc ref
  ([#21](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/21)).
* Add `z` command to combiner code syntax
  ([#21](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/21)).
* Add `clone` command to pfsc module syntax
  ([#22](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/22)).

Bug Fixes

* Widget group control mappings across windows used to be able to create an
  inconsistent state after the primary window was reloaded. Now such mappings
  are properly saved and restored
  ([#16](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/16)).
* Manual sorting of tabs is now properly recorded in the saved state
  ([#17](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/17)).
* Stopped build from crashing if a whole module was (accidentally) named in a
  meson script
  ([#19](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/19)).
* Doc refs can no longer be defined under `pdf` field in nodes; instead,
  must now use `doc` field
  ([#21](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/21)).
* New pdf widget syntax: `selection` becomes `sel`; `sel: true` is new default
  ([#21](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/21)).

## 0.26.1 (221216)

Improvements:

* Add `--auto-deps` option to `flask pfsc build` command. Also improve
  error handling in this command
  ([#12](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/12)).

Bug Fixes:

* Repair image name in `admin.sh` script generated by `pfsc deploy generate`
  when `--official` switch is used.

## 0.26.0 (221211)

Breaking Changes:

* (Re)combined `pfsc-server`, `pfsc-ise`, and `pfsc-manage` into one `pise`
  repository. These projects were taken at their latest versions, `0.25.1`,
  `25.4`, and `0.25.1` respectively.

## 0.25.1 (221122)

Improvements:

* Record more useful information in the manifest. For MODULE nodes, we now
  provide both `isTerminal` and `hasSubmodules`
  ([#6](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/6)).
* Add `PFSC_DEFAULT_TRUSTED_LIBPATHS` config var.
* Support env-var-based startup for `pfsc-server` docker containers (command- 
  based is still supported).

Bug Fixes:

* Prevent redundant edges from crashing the build process when factored through
  a method node
  ([#8](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/8)).

Upgrades:

* `pytest==7.2.0` addresses a Dependabot alert re `py<=1.11.0`.
* `pytest-cov==4.0.0` while we're at it.

## 0.25.0 (221028)

Breaking Changes:

* In a move to no longer repeat ourselves with JS version numbers, we load JS
  assets in new ways ([#4](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/4)).

Requires:

* `pfsc-ise >= 25.0`
* `pfsc-manage >= 0.25.0`

## 0.24.0 (221016)

Features:

* Add `pdfjsURL` to the served state. The URL includes a version number
  ([#3](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/3)).

Breaking Changes:

* Serve native static assets under URLs including this project's version number
  ([#3](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/3)).

Requires:

* `pfsc-manage >= 0.24.0`

## 0.23.5 (220920)

Features:

* Add `loginsPossible` to served state.


## 0.23.4 (220919)

Bug Fixes:

* Make demo repos usable when ALLOW_WIP is False
  ([#2](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/2)).
