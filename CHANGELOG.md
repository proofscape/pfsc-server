## 0.26.1 (221216)

Improvements:

* Add `--auto-deps` option to `flask pfsc build` command. Also improve
  error handling in this command
  ([#12](https://github.com/proofscape/pise/pull/12)).

Bug Fixes:

* Repair image name in `admin.sh` script generated by `pfsc deploy generate`
  when `--official` switch is used.

## 0.26.0 (221211)

Breaking Changes:

* (Re)combined `pfsc-server`, `pfsc-ise`, and `pfsc-manage` into one `pise`
  repository. These projects were taken at their latest versions, `0.25.1`,
  `25.4`, and `0.25.1` respectively.

## 0.25.1 (221122)

Improvements:

* Record more useful information in the manifest. For MODULE nodes, we now
  provide both `isTerminal` and `hasSubmodules`
  ([#6](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/6)).
* Add `PFSC_DEFAULT_TRUSTED_LIBPATHS` config var.
* Support env-var-based startup for `pfsc-server` docker containers (command- 
  based is still supported).

Bug Fixes:

* Prevent redundant edges from crashing the build process when factored through
  a method node
  ([#8](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/8)).

Upgrades:

* `pytest==7.2.0` addresses a Dependabot alert re `py<=1.11.0`.
* `pytest-cov==4.0.0` while we're at it.

## 0.25.0 (221028)

Breaking Changes:

  assets in new ways ([#4](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/4)).

Requires:

* `pfsc-ise >= 25.0`
* `pfsc-manage >= 0.25.0`

## 0.24.0 (221016)

Features:

* Add `pdfjsURL` to the served state. The URL includes a version number
  ([#3](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/3)).

Breaking Changes:

* Serve native static assets under URLs including this project's version number
  ([#3](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-server/pull/3)).

Requires:

* `pfsc-manage >= 0.24.0`

## 0.23.5 (220920)
